# cme.mdp

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of cme.mdp is to clean Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) market data with FIX protocol more easily in the R environment, including but not limited to trade summaries, quote updates, and limit order book reconstruction. 

Financial markets have become more transparent and exchanges can provide high-frequency data for traders to better monitor markets, which creates more demand about the high-frequency data usage both in the academia and industry. Most exchanges do not disseminate tabulated complete market data to non-member market participants, and almost all market data are specially coded to enhance the communication efficiency. Thus, financial economists need to know how to clean these untabulated data at first, which is a substantially time-consuming task. This project will closely focus on how to parse and clean the market data of Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) under the FIX and MDP protocols and provide other statistical procedures related to market liquidity (in later version).

## CME market data overview

So far, there have been Market by Price (MBP) data which aggregates all individual order information (e.g., size) at every price level, and Market by Order (MBO) data that can show all individual order details (e.g., order priority) at each price level. The MBO data also provide more information about trade summaries than the MBP, so that traders are able to know which limit orders are matched in each trade and their corresponding matching quantities. The detailed trade summaries also assign the trade direction more precisely than the MBP and no quote merge is required for almost all trades. In general, CME will disseminate the MBP incremental updates followed by the order-level details (e.g., submission, cancellation) that describes the reason for MBP updates. Our package considers the above characters and can process both the MBP and MBO data including quote messages and trade summaries.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cme.mdp from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools") #Install the 'devtools' package if you haven't
devtools::install_github("richie-ma/cme.mdp")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(cme.mdp)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
